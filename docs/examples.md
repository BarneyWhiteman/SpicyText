# Examples
The library contains 5 examples of increasing complexity that show most of what the library has to offer.

It's recommended that you read through the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page before exploring the examples.
This will walk you through installing the library, show you a trivial example, and explain a bit more about how the library works.

## Access the examples
The examples can either be accessed via the Processing IDE or viewed on the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/BarneyWhiteman/SpicyText/tree/main/examples)

!!! Note
    I haven't included the example code here simply because I want to minimise the places I have to maintain them.
    What IS included in this page is a high-level explanation of what each example contains. The comments in the example
    should be sufficient to explain what's going on. If you have any questions, please just [reach out!](mailto:barney@barneycodes.com)

**To access via the Processing IDE:**
1. Navigate to `File` > click on `Examples...` to open the `Java Examples` window.
2. Expand the `Contributed Libraries` category
3. Expand the `SpicyText` sub-category
4. Double-click the desired example to open it in the Processing IDE
