## Processing Libraries
This library was created using the [Processing Library Template](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template/) created by Claudine Chen ([@mingness](https://github.com/mingness)) as part of the 2024 New Beginnings (pr05) Grant from the 
[Processing Foundation](https://github.com/processing), to simplify the
workflows for libraries, tools, and modes, mentored by Stef Tervelde ([@Stefterv](https://github.com/stefterv)).
